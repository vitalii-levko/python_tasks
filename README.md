## Palindrome

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward.

Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.

For example, _is_palindrome("Deleveled")_ should return _True_ as character case should be ignored, resulting in "deleveled", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.

```python
class Palindrome:

    @staticmethod
    def is_palindrome(word):
        return None

print(Palindrome.is_palindrome('Deleveled'))
```
